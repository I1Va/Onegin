and only wish that my employment
and records of a heart in pain

But, as it is, this pied collection
Chapter One
could have been turned to worthier ends
from threads both sad and humoristic
Heedless of the proud world's enjoyment
in limpid verse that lives and gleams
in simple but sublime reflection
I prize the attention of my friends
of powers unripe, or on the wane
of reason's icy intimations
of sleeplessness, faint inspirations
products of carefree hours, of fun
themes popular or idealistic
To Peter Alexandrovich Pletnev
worthier of you in the perfection
your soul displays, in holy dreams

To Peter Alexandrovich Pletnev

     Heedless of the proud world's enjoyment,
     I prize the attention of my friends,
     and only wish that my employment
     could have been turned to worthier ends --
     worthier of you in the perfection
     your soul displays, in holy dreams,
     in simple but sublime reflection,
     in limpid verse that lives and gleams.
     But, as it is, this pied collection
     begs your indulgence -- it's been spun
     from threads both sad and humoristic,
     themes popular or idealistic,
     products of carefree hours, of fun,
     of sleeplessness, faint inspirations,
     of powers unripe, or on the wane,
     of reason's icy intimations,
     and records of a heart in pain.
